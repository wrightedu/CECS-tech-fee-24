| Electronic Materials Lab | 116 Russ | $35,000 |
| Mobile Laptop Carts (x3) | 405 Russ\* | $90,000 \*\* |

Notes:

* \* Location is just a suggestion of an appropriately sized space
* \*\* Total Cost estimate depends greatly on quantity of equipment or a specific optional item

### Compressed Air

The new ADMETE circuit fabrication space will be tying in to the building compressed air supply.  The lab needs for compressed air are:

* 2 qty LPKF S64 machines, each needing 75 Liters per minute @ 90 psi minimum
* 1 qty LPKF protoLaser system needing 185 Liters per minute @ 87 psi minimum

Approximate total assuming all machines are in use at the same time: 335 Liters per minute @ 90 psi

Times where all three of the above machines to need to be operational simultaneously should be minimal and can be limited if necessary.  Use should be relatively intermittent, estimated to be one to two jobs per week.

### High Performance Computing (HPC) upgrade 

* Location: 262 Russ 
* Cost: $490,557

The current HPC cluster has the following resources:

* 24x general compute nodes, each with 2 CPU's and 180 GB RAM (5+ years old)
* 1x parallel GPU system with 8x Nvidia P100 GPU's, 2 CPU's, and 256 GB RAM (6+ years old)
* 2x single GPU systems with 1x Nvidia A100 GPU, 2 CPU's, and 256 GB RAM (1 year old)
* 60 TB shared high speed storage (1 year old)
* 200 GB/s high speed network connecting all nodes and storage clusters (1 year old)

Given space and age constraints, several options exist to upgrade the current resources.  
This request is identical to the request submitted to "Super RAPIDS" but can be scaled 
in both directions depending on needs / resources.  Proposed upgrades include:

* 2x new "high end" GPU nodes (Nvidia H100) @ $70,000 per node
* 4x new "low end" GPU nodes (Nvidia L40) @ $42,000 per node
* 2x new "large RAM" nodes (2TB RAM per node) @ $26,000 per node
* 10x new "general compute" nodes @ $12,000 per node
* new rack, power, network infrastructure for above equipment @ $20,000

This new equipment will rely on the most recent upgrades for the core backbone 
of the cluster and all older systems can still be utilized but will provide 
newer GPU systems at both the high and low end to accomodate more workloads and 
better use of resources while investigating teaching and reserach opportunities.

### Boffin Design Space 

* Proposed location: 018 Russ
* Cost: $35,000 

To facilitate usage of the two fabrication spaces below, a collaborative design space providing
access to laptops, large format displays, whiteboards, projectors, etc. is requested.  The core 
purpose of a design space is to provide students with a space near the fabrication labs but not
*in* the fabrication spaces where they can collaborate, work on their design, and plan out their
safe use of the required tools and facilities.  

This space should support multiple small groups
working independently, as well as individual students that need a workspace to assemble components
created in any of the below fabrication spaces.  While this space could be used for large group meetings
or classes, this should not be its primary purpose as this detracts from the goal of having a set space 
to go work on their design / planned use of other facilities.

### Boffin Advanced Fabrication Space 

* Proposed location: 030 / 028 Russ 
* Cost: $50,000 - $150,000

The Boffin Advanced Fabrication space would house a variety of advanced fabrication 
equipment for students to use both formally for educational purposes as well as 
informally in a Maker-Space type environment for students to apply engineering approaches
learned in their schooling to their personal projects.

Equipment requests include:

* 3D printers and various scanners / filaments/ resins and related equipment
* Laser cutting and etching resources
* Soldering, electronics testing, inspection equipment
* Oscilloscopes, function generators, power supplies, etc.
* Required Fume hoods, safety, and cleaning equipment

At the lower end of the cost we would remove some of the more expensive capabilities 
(one item specced is a 4'x4' Kern metal laser cutter costing approximately $60,000).

See attached Boffin fab space - Advanced Fabrication Space excel sheet.

### Boffin Fabrication Space 
 
* Proposed location: 024 / 026 Russ
* Cost: $100,000 

The Boffin (basic) Fabrication space would house standard wood and other soft material
manipulation tools in the vein of a classic wood shop.  Band saws, chop saws, compound-miter 
saws, basic hand and power tools, clamps, and workbenches will allow students a place to 
go to perform the needed "roughing in" of any materials as well as perform any specialty 
mechanical assembly.

Room would require a dust collection system.  Compressed air would be a useful addition.

See attached Boffin fab space - Basic Fabrication Space excel sheet.

### Mobile Laptop Carts 

* Proposed Location 405 Russ
* Cost: $90,000 
* Purpose: Support courses within the college that are using a Russ teaching space without laptops

Since the CS department has moved to a mostly Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) model 
there have already been several requests for laptop carts with *some* number of 
laptops be made available for CS / CEG / other college courses that are scheduled
in a Russ (or other) classroom that does not have computer available.  

Recommendations are as follows:

* 3x Dell laptop cart (holds a max of 30 laptops) @ $2,000 per cart
* 15-30x Dell laptops per cart @ $1,330 per laptop

Fully populated ( each cart with 30 laptops ) each cart will cost approximately $35,000 - $40,000.
CSE is currently only providing ~15 laptops for a 36 seat classroom.

### Electronic Materials Lab 

* Location 116 Russ 
* Cost: $35,000
* Purpose: refresh all old equipment in the current ceramics lab to support electronic materials coatings

The current Ceramics Materials lab (116 Russ) is being upgraded via ADMETE funds to 
update the flooring, work surfaces, power, air handling, and water.  This update is 
meant to help transform this space for inter-departmental teaching in support of 
the ADMETE mission and will house the ADMETE electronics environmental 
testing chamber.  Since this space will hopefully serve Materials students as well as
EE/CEG Admete students a refresh of all older equipment in the space would significantly
increase its curb appeal while also providing some useful college wide benefits.

Chief among these are two externally venting fume hoods, a de-ionised water system, 
and possibly a distilled water production system.  These resources can be made available 
to all departments that are in need of specialized water or ventilation systems.

Due to the late nature of this request I am still waiting on a list of equipment that would
be needed for this space but I am working with Doug Yost and Dan Young to generate this list.
